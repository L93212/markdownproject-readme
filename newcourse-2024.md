# Welcome to the website of Onja Toamasina
We are going to build a Markdown intro website. You might have written plain text documents before, but Markdown helps make your text more organized and easier to consume. Look at the two pieces of text below and think about which is easier to read and more pleasant on the eyes.
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around;">
 <img src='./non_markdown_image.png'>

  <strong style=''>vs</strong>

<img src='./markdown_image.png'>

</div>

Here are a few basic Markdown commands to make your text better:

1. **Headings**:
   Use `#`, `##`, `###` for headings.
   # This is a Main Heading
   ## This is a Subheading
   ### This is a Smaller Subheading
